## Smart Building Android app for Administrator
This app includes light, ventilation, elevator and garage control from one screen only. I used frames from 3Ds Max simulations in order to show which part of building has been selected by user. Design reminds to user a remote control and it is very easy to adapt to the interface.
In Backend, we have Adafruit.io webserver in which we subscribe to a channel which connected to the Controller of smart building. Those channels provide data exchange between controller and app.
For Administrator means that, he/she can control all parts of building. There is another app which control only one floor of building.
